Notes is an application that manages your tasks and notes. 

All you have to do is to choose a type of your note. If the note asks to be detailed, just choose the "Notes" tab on the bottom navigation view, but if you have to create a short task choose the "Tasks" tab.

## Notes tab

To create a new note, you must press the round button at the bottom right corner of the screen with the "+" sign (Step 1). Then a new window will be opened and will ask us to enter data of the note: Title, Description, and Photo (Step 2-3). If the photo wasn't chosen the app will add a standard photo of note. Then we must press the "Add" button and the note will be added to the list of Notes. If it's necessary to refresh the Note we just must touch on any place of the note in the main list of notes (Step 1) and we will get a window for refreshing (Step 3) but with the "Refresh" button instead of "Add". The note will be refreshed after this step in the main list.

To delete any of the notes we just need to swipe your note to the left and an icon for deleting will be shown (Step 1). Press the button and a warning message will be shown asking us if we want to delete this note. Press "Yes" if we are sure we want to delete this note and it will be deleted from the main list (Step 3) or press "No" to cancel deleting.
